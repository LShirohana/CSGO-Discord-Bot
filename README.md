# CSGOFOOD-Discord-Bot
Hello, This is CSGOFoodReviews's private discord bot that I like to tinker with and test things with. You can copy it and edit it to your likings. I do not mind.

It requires node.js of course, and the main food is located in bot.js. To add the bot's login, go to auth.js.

Just do a simple "node bot.js" and it'll start! Happy discording.
